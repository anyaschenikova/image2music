# Poetry and Music Generation from Images: Thesis Project

Welcome to the repository for the thesis project, "Poetry and Music Generation from Images using NLP and CV Tools." This project features the development of a unique model capable of generating music from input images, leveraging advancements in Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Computer Vision (CV).

## Music Generation Model

Music generation model has been developed by fine-tuning the concatenation of two pre-trained models: ViT and Bart. Bart has been specifically fine-tuned for generating music from text. 

The model can be accessed through the following link:

## Dataset 

To fine-tune this model and achieve optimal results, a unique dataset, `image2music` in ABC format, has been curated. This dataset is also publicly accessible:

- [AnyaSchen/image2music_abc Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/AnyaSchen/image2music_abc)

## Important Note 

Please note that the generated music is in ABC format. You would need to convert it to audio using tools such as the [ABC Editor](https://editor.drawthedots.com/). Additionally, do pay attention to the BPM (Beats Per Minute) to maintain a natural speed for the music.
